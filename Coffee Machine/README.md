Project: Coffee Machine (Java)
Keep track of the supplies

Description

Just one action is not so interesting, is it? Let's improve the program so it can do multiple actions, one after another. It should repeatedly ask a user 
what they want to do. If the user types "buy", "fill" or "take", then the program should do exactly the same thing it did in the previous step. However, 
if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, they should type "exit". The program should terminate on this command. Also, when the user types "remaining", 
the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has. This means that you shouldn't show the remaining stock levels at the beginning/end of the program.

Remember, that:

    For the espresso, the coffee machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans. It costs $4.
    For the latte, the coffee machine needs 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffee beans. It costs $7.
    And for the cappuccino, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffee. It costs $6.

Objectives

Write a program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested persons until the shutdown signal is given. Introduce two new options: "remaining" and "exit".

Do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee. If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message 
that says it can't make a cup of coffee and state what is missing.

And the last improvement to the program at this step — if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, they should be able to type "back" to return 
into the main cycle.
Example

Your coffee machine should have the same initial resources as in the example (400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, 9 disposable cups, $550 in cash).

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
